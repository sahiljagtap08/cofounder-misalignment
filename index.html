            <p>hey jessie!</p>

            <p>i wanted to talk about where we r with airstitch and us as cofounders.</p>

            <p>over the last few weeks it's become really clear that we're operating from very different places - different levels of conviction, different comfort with uncertainty, different speeds. and that kind of misalignment at the founder level isn't something we can really build around.</p>

            <p>ik this conversation probably sucks to have, but i think it's the right one to have now rather than later when things are more complicated or when there's real tension between us.</p>

            <p>i just wanna be clear on what i've been seeing:</p>

            <p>i'm wired to push hard - ship daily, talk to users constantly, test fast, chase distribution, iterate on everything. i get energized by moving fast even when things are uncertain. that's just how i operate at this stage.</p>

            <p>you've been honest that you're unsure about the idea and hesitant about moving forward. and i really appreciate that honesty - i know that wasn't easy to say. but it tells me we're in different headspaces about this.</p>

            <p>neither of us is wrong here. we're just not aligned. and that mismatch creates friction that slows us down.</p>

            <p>i take calculated risks and move with incomplete information because that's what early stage requires. you prefer more certainty before committing. that's not a flaw - it's just a different operating rhythm. but at 0 to 1, that difference becomes really significant.</p>

            <p>when we hit 116 users and 16 paying customers in 10 days, you said "nobody wants this" even though every external signal was positive - reddit responses, twitter engagement, people literally paying us money. that moment made it clear to me that we're evaluating progress really differently.</p>

            <p>when we talked about compute costs, the first reaction was "what if this is a waste" instead of "how do we make revenue cover compute." those are fundamentally different ways of thinking about problems.</p>

            <p>i'm not listing these to dump on you - i'm saying them because they show we approach building, risk, and decision-making differently. and at the founder level, that creates real problems.</p>

            <p>the other thing is contribution and ownership. the core founder work - product building, tech decisions, growth, customer discovery, early revenue - has mostly been on me. your contributions have been helpful, but not at the founder ownership level the company needs right now.</p>

            <p>i handled engineering, product direction, first customers, launch, early revenue, and a lot of the frontend and gtm work that was originally your area. on your side, there wasn't equivalent forward momentum or leadership taking shape.</p>

            <p>also, i want to be transparent about one more thing. a big part of early traction comes from momentum, visibility, and consistent public presence. when i pushed for linkedin posts, it wasn't about "timing" - it was about creating that energy around what we were building, the momentum (there is never a right time to start posting in public about what you are building).</p>

            <p>we consistently got strong validation from Reddit, X, LinkedIn, and the first 112 users. That momentum matters, and when you weren't comfortable posting or kept framing things negatively ("people aren't excited about the product"), it became clear we weren't aligned on how to build traction or shape the narrative.</p>

            <p>that difference in mindset is totally okay - but it also means we weren't a fit as cofounders. i hope this clarifies everything.</p>

            <p>again - this isn't personal. you're smart and capable and i genuinely respect you. but a startup only works if both founders are all-in, pushing at the same intensity, with the same conviction. and that's not where we are.</p>

            <p>because of all this, i think the right move is for us to part ways as cofounders now, before things get more tense or complicated.</p>

            <p>since we're still within the 1-year cliff, nothing has vested yet. the cleanest path forward is to separate amicably now.</p>

            <p>if you want to stay lightly connected, i'm happy to offer you an advisor role with 0.25% equity vested over 2 years. completely optional - just goodwill for the early work you did. no pressure either way.</p>

            <p>i'll send over separation documents so we can wrap this up cleanly and professionally.</p>

            <p>i know this cofounder breakup sucks and i'm sorry it didn't work out. but i'm giving you this feedback because i think it'll actually matter for your next thing. startups require extreme alignment, extreme ownership, and extreme conviction. when those aren't there, it's better to recognize it early.</p>

            <p>i genuinely want you to grow from this and do something great. this just isn't the right fit for us to build together.</p>

            <p>wishing you the best, truly.</p>
